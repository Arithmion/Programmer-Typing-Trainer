# Programmer-Typing-Trainer
A CLI typing trainer for the symbols used in programming. (Curly braces, ampersands, numbers, pipes, etc.) Upskill yourself!

Directions: Download and run the .exe or compile yourself (written in Go). Default amount of characters per attempt is 40, or use the "-amount" flag to set a custom amount if running via CLI. Uses the Levenshtein string distance algorithm to compute accuracy. Errors are not counted against WPM. WPM count assumed 5 chars per word (a standard amoung typing tests for standard English).
